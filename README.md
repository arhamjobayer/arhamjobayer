Hello, my name is **Arham Ahmed Jobayer**. I am a student of Computer Science and Engineering with a passion for coding, cinematography, and football. I’m a big fan of Leo Messi and Argentina. In my free time, I enjoy doing photography and video editing. I run a page and Instagram where I share cinematic content, and I've gathered over 150K+ followers. 

My dream is to build an IT firm, and I’ve already worked on several projects using **Next.js**, **shadcn/ui**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. In addition to tech, I enjoy working on **client-server programming**, and I'm currently enhancing my skills in **artificial intelligence** and **networking**.

Besides tech, I’m all about creating memorable moments through my lens, whether through photography or video.

Feel free to collaborate with me on projects, whether it's about web development, creative content, or anything in between. Let's build something amazing together!
